# USI_RO
Realism Overhaul configs for RoverDude's USI Kolonization System.
This mod (or rather, a collection of configs) makes adjustments to RoverDude's USI Kolonization System mod, so it would be playable with Realism Overhaul.
Some general changes compared to the original mod are inherent from the realism:

* Agricultural modules will only recycle/produce food. For water and oxygen, you'll have to provide separate converters (take a look at the Water Purifier and the Water Splitter from TACLS).
* Life Support Recyclers have been removed, as they are extremely unrealistic. Pods and rover command modules have CO2 Scrubbers, but that's it. (in the future, I might add built in CO2 -> Oxygen, and WasteWater -> Water recyclers to these)
* The switchable containers now have modular tanks. There's two kind of containers: liquid, and solid. Liquid containers are basically Service Module tanks, so they can hold any fuel, EC, and life support. Solid containers contain all the rest.
* Because of the way Realism Overhaul works, you probably won't be able to launch and ship large bases in one go.

The mod works with TACLS and USI-LS at the same time, so you can play it with the nice limited Habitation time of USI-LS. However, some settings changes are recommended:

* Set the Supplies effect and EC effect to "None", as TACLS takes care of those.
* Set the Habitation multiplier to 2, so you can have 2-week missions without needing a Habitation module. You can set this to even higher if you want to have an easier time.

So far the mod is playable, but some modules might still have some problems. Feel free to raise these, and I'll address them as soon as I can.
